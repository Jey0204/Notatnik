# Notatnik
This is an application that allows you to create, edit and delete notes. The creation process involves giving a name to the note, defining its category, setting the note's importance level (1-3) and entering its actual content. In the main window, displaying a list of created notes, you can sort notes by category and importance. In addition, we can also display notes with a specific level of importance. At the same time, in the upper part of the screen we are constantly informed about the number of notes with the highest level of importance.

In the main application window, we can sort notes and display notes of specific levels of importance through buttons representing the note's importance by the number of stars.

After clicking "add", we are redirected to the window for creating a new note. From here we can return to the previous window by clicking "back". Here we enter the name, category and content of the note, as well as set its importance.

Now our note has appeared on the list. Since the weight is set to 3 (newer phone models display stars instead of numbers), we are informed that the number of very important notes is equal to 1.

By clicking on a note, the note editing window opens, where you can change its data. This window also allows you to delete a specific note.
